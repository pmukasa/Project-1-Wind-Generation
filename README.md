# Project-1
Wind Generation Time Series Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analyse wind generation data to ascertain any signs of seasonality

Make use of ramps generated from the data as key insights to make decisions on how to balance supply and demand for National grids

Carrying out model analysis to establish the best model for forecasting wind generation. The comparision was between ARIMA, SMA and a persistance benchmark
